# Roll20-Dark-Theme
Dark theme for Roll20. Fully compatible with the base editor as well as the 5e Shaped and OGL sheets.
Also compatible with the VTT Enhancement Suite (formerly Roll20 Enhancement Suite) extension!

## NOTICE: This is a fork of the original repository and a WORK IN PROGRESS. I make no promises as to
how far I'll take this. It's just a pet project for now. In addition, the Roll 20 team is continuing to
make changes to their sheets as of today (3/21/21), so things might as well just break again. I will be
happy to pass this off to an ACTIVE, LONG-TERM volunteer for maintenance. In the meantime, I'll be updating
the dark mode theme as I have time.

## Installation:
- Install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension on your browser.

  (Greasemonkey and other userscript extensions may work, but are not currently supported.)
- [Download and open the userscript in your browser](https://openuserjs.org/src/scripts/sdlambert/Roll20_Dark.user.js).

- Enjoy!
